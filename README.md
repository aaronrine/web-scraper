# Web Scraper/Data API

## Project Info

### Tech Stack

Python 3.9.2 <br>
BeautifulSoup4 <br>
Matplotlib

### Project Purpose

I made this project to learn python and web scraping technologies, as well as learning to connect it to a frontend using an API.

### Project Outcome

This is a very small yet effective script that pulls information about stock market indices and uses it to show the latest market movement. In making it I learned how to: write more pythonic code, simplify loops and if statements using list comprehension, and simplifying nested lists into dictionaries.
