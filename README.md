# Web Scraper/Data API

## Project Info

### Tech Stack

`Python 3.9.2` <br>
`BeautifulSoup4` <br>
`Matplotlib`

### Project Purpose

I made this project to learn python and web scraping technologies, as well as learning to connect it to a frontend using an API.

### Project Outcome

This is a very small yet effective script that pulls information about stock market indices and uses it to show the latest market movement. In making it I learned how to: write more pythonic code, simplify loops and if statements using list comprehension, and simplifying nested lists into dictionaries.

## Install the Script

### Install Python for your system:
